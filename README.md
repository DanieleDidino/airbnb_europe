# Airbnb Cleaned Europe Dataset

In this repository, you will find the preprocessing steps I performed on the data before loading it into Tableau to create a dashboard.

I used this dataset to practice creating Tableau Dashboards.

You can access the original dataset on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dipeshkhemani/airbnb-cleaned-europe-dataset) in Kaggle.

This dataset combines information on Airbnb prices from nine European cities: Amsterdam, Athens, Barcelona, Berlin, Budapest, Lisbon, Paris, Rome, and Vienna.
